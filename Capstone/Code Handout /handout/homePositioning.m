% homePositioning(robot, robotHardware, frequency)
%   inputs:
%       robot: object of robot class (required to do inverse kinematics)
%       robotHardware: hebi group 
%       frequency: rate at which you want to send commands to robot
%   output: 
%       trajectory: the final trajectory from initial positions to homing
%       position
% The function takes the robot from any initial position to home position
% in two steps. First step is to move the shoulder joint to safe position.
% This is done to safe position the other joints so that they do not hit
% the table while you move them to home position.
