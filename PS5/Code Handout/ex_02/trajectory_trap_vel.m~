function [ trajectory ] = trajectory_trap_vel(waypoints, times, frequency, duty_cycle)
% trajectory_const_vel
%
%   Returns a matrix of joint angles, where each column represents a single
%   timestamp. These joint angles form trapezoidal velocity trajectory segments,
%   hitting waypoints(:,i) at times(i).
%
%   'waypoints' is a matrix of waypoints; each column represents a single
%   waypoint in joint space, and each row represents a particular joint.
%
%   'times' is a row vector that indicates the time each of the waypoints should
%   be reached.  The number of columns should equal the number of waypoints, and
%   should be monotonically increasing.  The first number is technically
%   arbitrary, as it serves only as a reference for the remaining timestamps,
%   but '0' is a good default.
%
%   'frequency' is the control frequency which this trajectory should be played
%   at, and therefore the number of columns per second of playback.

% Number of joints:
num_joints = size(waypoints, 1);
% Number of waypoints:
num_waypoints = size(waypoints, 2);
% Number of segments between waypoints:
num_segments = num_waypoints - 1;

if (size(times) ~= [1, num_waypoints])
    error('Size of times vector is incorrect!');
end

if (num_waypoints < 2)
    error('Insufficient number of waypoints.');
end

if (length(frequency) ~= 1 || frequency < 5)
    error('Invalid control frequency (must be at least 5Hz)');
end

if (duty_cycle < 0 || duty_cycle > 0.5)
    error('Invalid duty cycle!');
