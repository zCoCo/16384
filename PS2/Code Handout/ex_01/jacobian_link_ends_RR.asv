function [ jacobians ] = jacobian_link_ends_RR(theta)
% jacobian_link_ends_RR
%
%   Returns a vector of Jacobian matrices, corresponding
%   to points on the distal end of each link, given the
%   joint angle positions [rad]. The Jacobians computed here
%   are relative to R^2 only (i.e., no theta term).
%
%   The function returns N 2xN matrices, where N is the
%   number of links (and also the number of joints).
%
%   Each matrix describes the differential relationship between
%   a vector of joint angle velocities and the (x,y) motion of the
%   corresponding point.
%
%   Hints
%   - 'theta' is a vector. Individual angles can be selected
%      using indices, e.g., theta1 = theta(1)

% Get information about the robot:
robot = robot_info();
% Extract length of the links
l1 = robot.link_lengths(1);
l2 = robot.link_lengths(2);
